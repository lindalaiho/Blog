>“Do you want to do the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differently from everyone else?”
-- Paul Graham in [one of his recent essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html).

My instinctual answer to that question is yes. I suspect most, if not all scientists, would give the same answer. Coming up with novel ideas that no one has ever thought of before is the ultimate task in science, one which cannot be done without thinking differently from everyone around you. The ability to do so may even be a defining feature of a successful scientist. Then *why* is scientific education selecting for conformity?

As undergraduates, we are marked on our ability to solve problem sets with defined correct answers. We are ranked based on our ability to get to the right answer on exams. Essays have marking schemes or a marker who evaluates the writing based on his or her notions of what makes a good essay. Practicals are all about following steps in a manual with subsequent tests to check our understanding of the data we generated. The one who gets the predetermined answer right the most times wins. The one who conforms to the standards set by the examiners/markers wins.

It’s hard to apply any other approach when you have 300 students to teach and they must receive standardized marks to allow student achievement to be compared. But we need to be aware that we are essentially selecting for conformity by picking future scientists from a pool of undergraduates based on their university marks.

You could argue that the students with the highest marks are also the most motivated ones and granted, motivation is essential to have in science. But is it the right kind of motivation? I worked hard to do well at university but it was in large part an empty competition with peers, my success was not driven by my passion for biology. To be honest, I didn’t learn to love science through my university courses. I learned it from everything I was doing outside of my official studies, exploring questions on my own. I think René Girard’s mimetic theory applies in this context. According to Girard, we are competitive by nature and often are not quite sure what to strive for, so we adopt the desires of our peers – in this case, academic achievement which in turn may lead to other rewards.

Once we get into the world of working scientists, you would think that the environment is set up to promote bold, original thinking. Yet funding agencies are risk averse – it is difficult to get funding for ideas that go against the accepted paradigm, at least without convincing preliminary data. The difficult academic job market makes early career researchers unlikely to risk their potential future career doing science that is difficult to promote and has a high chance of “failing”. It is simply not easy to pursue ideas brought on by thinking differently in today’s scientific environment.

I do want to take a moment to clarify something. I think we need all kinds of scientists, not only those who want to overturn paradigms and come up with innovative approaches (I wrote about this in [Snow ploughs and salt trucks]({{ "/2021/03/02/snow-ploughs-and.html" | absolute_url }}). We need scientists who fill in the gaps in knowledge and replicate previous experiments. We need scientists who promote and engage in science beyond the academic sphere. But we shouldn’t have a system where you lose by thinking differently from everybody else, be that in education or in scientific practice.

There is a danger to thinking differently: when you take it to the extremes, both in magnitude and in range. If all you do in science is take distance from existing work and adopt the contrarian stance on every point, you are not really thinking differently. Critical thinking involves choosing your battles, which facts to question and which to accept. The other danger is letting the need to differentiate your thinking from everyone else’s spill into all areas of life. Sometimes it is all right to just agree with people.
I don’t like highlighting problems without having possible solutions at hand. But in this case, we are facing a substantial beast. Redesigning our education system and changing the way scientific funding is allocated is not easily done, nor do I know if that is what we need to do. This was merely a first attempt to bring a problem to light. To find ways to address that problem we need to – ahem – think differently.
