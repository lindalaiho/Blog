After many mild winters in a row, Mother Nature decided to overcompensate this year and unleashed on us more snow and cold days than even the most fervent winter enthusiast could ask for. I do like a snowy landscape on days when the sun makes a rare appearance, but there are aspects of winter that I could do without – namely being woken up by all the road clearing that happens at such an ungodly hour. One morning, instead of being annoyed, I had a think about the winter service vehicles driving around outside and what they might have to do with science.

Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, Marie Curie. Even Rosalind Franklin. In a parallel universe where scientists get reincarnated as vehicles, I bet these individuals would have been snow ploughs. Snow ploughs are the heroes of treacherous wintry roads. They are always first at the scene, ready to uncover the roads and create paths for others to follow. They are literal trailblazers that go where no other vehicle has gone before (that morning at least, if the snow has been heavy). They work alone but together their efforts create the network of cleared roads that the rest of the city relies on.

However, the system would break down if all we had were snow ploughs. We also need salt trucks to carry out the much less glamorous tasks of salting, gritting and de-icing the roads. These vehicles maintain the roads, fill out the tracks created by snow ploughs and do their best to make the roads walkable and driveable to others. To me, salt trucks are like the everyday scientists, science communicators and teachers who do much of the heavy lifting without getting credit for it. These are the people who fill in the gaps of knowledge after the snow plough scientists have moved on to make the next big discovery. People who translate snow plough knowledge into something that can be understood and used by the rest of us. People who educate a new generation of innovators.

Yet, in science and society more broadly, we celebrate only the snow ploughs. If I ask you to think of a ‘scientific hero’, what comes to mind is probably someone similar to the names I mentioned above – someone dressed in a lab coat, famous for a theory or discovery we have all learned about in school. These people certainly deserve being called heroes but this practice of elevating a few big names above everyone comes with its problems. It implies that all the valuable contributions to science come from the snow ploughs and that the best scientists are the ones who make the biggest breakthroughs. That is obviously not true but it still remains a pervasive sentiment.

What if I would rather be a salt truck than a snow plough? I don’t want to be extraordinary, just do rigorous science and have fun in the process. Share why science is so exciting with friends and family and help others get started on their scientific journeys. That shouldn’t make me a bad scientist but it’s hard to sustain a career in science these days unless you are ready to join the snow plough competition. There are so many valuable ways to contribute to science, although not all of them get the recognition they deserve. Some of us will be snow ploughs, others will be salt trucks or perhaps snow blowers or loaders. We recognise that all the winter service vehicles are essential for a successful result – could we do the same for their science counterparts as well?
